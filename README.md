**The_Black_Tiger** tool is focused on* **OSINT** *almost all areas* **(People, Nicknames, Social Networks, Emails, Phone Numbers, Web Pages, Public IPs and Images)** *My idea was to collect and automate all the most Advanced OSINT techniques possible in a single Tool and thus work in the most comfortable and fast way possible, since we only have to give a couple of clicks and it will only start collecting and displaying in an orderly and classified manner all the information. All Sections are separated into parts in case you only want to extract a specific type of information, but it also has the penultimate option that combines all the Options so that it can extract everything it is capable of from the data that we have entered. Tell you that I will be updating the repository, adding new things and solving errors.

## 🛠 Install Tool 🛠

**0)** Install and use the Tool with **Root**

**1)** sudo apt update && apt -y full-upgrade

**2)** sudo apt-get install git

**3)** git clone https://github.com/VirusZzHkP/The-Black-Tiger

**4)** cd the_black_tiger

**5)** chmod 777 the_black_tiger.sh

**6)** ./the_black_tiger.sh

**7)** We mark Option 0 and then 1 to install the dependencies (Only mark the first time)

**8)** Within Option 0 we find sections 2 and 3 in which we can configure
These free APIs to get the most out of the_black_tiger

**9)** We can now enjoy the tool

## 🎲 Take into account 🎲

**[1]** In Section ([0] Install and Configure Requirements) when we click on Option 1 to Install the Requirements it will ask us to add a user who **does not** have root permissions, this step is very important, since if we put a user with root permissions, or we write it wrong or we put it twice, the Options that have to open a Browser from the Terminal will not work.

**[2]** In Section ([0] Install and Configure Requirements) we can Configure the veriphone.io, shodan.io and zoomeye.org API to get the best out of this Tool, both are free.

**[3]** In Section ([7] Public IP Information) with the use of VPN, most servers give wrong answers about their ports. To solve this I have installed several Scanners and 2 of them give you the correct ports despite the VPN.

**[4]** Use the tool with Firefox closed, this is because the tool opens multiple tabs and if Firefox is already running an error will occur.

**[5]** I personally recommend using the Tool with the Terminal in Full Screen (Graphically prettier).

**[6]** In case you have downloaded an older version, I advise you to delete it and reinstall the tool (+requirements) to solve errors and obtain improvements, which make the tool much better than previous versions .
